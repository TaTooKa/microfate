Actions
=======

As it was briefly explained in the "Changes from Fate Core" section, one of the most notable differences in microFATE is that you always roll at +0, but **you have a free invoke on every Action** (that means that you will usually be rolling at +2 minimum).

You still cannot invoke the same Aspect more than once in the same Action.

Action Outcomes
---------------

Fail
~~~~

If you roll lower than your opposition, you fail.

Succeed
~~~~~~~

If you roll equal to or higher than your opposition by 1 or 2, you succeed.

Exceed
~~~~~~

If you roll higher than your opposition by 3 or more, you succeed with style (a Critical hit!).

Action Types
------------

Overcome
~~~~~~~~

*When your objective is to overcome an obstacle that is in your way...*

If you **Fail**: You either simply fail, or you succeed at a serious
cost.

If you **Succeed**: You simply succeed, without any cost.

If you **Exceed**: You succeed and create a Boost.

Create an Advantage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*When your objective is to do something that benefits you or your
allies, hinders an opponent, or changes the situation...*

If you **Fail**: Don’t create/alter an Aspect, or create/alter it but an
opponent gets the free invoke.

If you **Succeed**: You create/alter an Aspect and put a free invoke on
it.

If you **Exceed**: You create/alter an Aspect and put two free invokes
on it.

Attack
~~~~~~

*When your desired action’s outcome is to take out the opposition or place
Consequences on them…*

If you **Fail**: You don’t place any Consequences or take out your
opponent.

If you **Succeed**: You inflict a Mild Consequence on your opponent.

If you **Exceed**: You inflict a Moderate Consequence on your opponent.

Defend
~~~~~~

*When you attempt to avoid an Attack or prevent someone from Creating an
Advantage against you…*

If you **Fail**: You take a Consequence related to the Attack, get taken
out, or have an Advantage created against you.

If you **Succeed**: You avoid the attack or the attempt to gain
advantage on you.

If you **Exceed**: You avoid the attack or the attempt to gain advantage
on you, and also create a Boost.

Difficulty
----------

Difficulty for an Action roll can be either **fixed** or **opposed**.

When you attempt something against the environment or an entity that
cannot perform an action by themselves, it is normally a **fixed
difficulty**, arbitrarily set by the GM. It ranges from 0 to 8, being 2 to 4 the default for most
cases.

When your Action is made against an opponent or entity that can actively
defend, it is normally an **opposed roll**, with the defender setting the
difficulty with a Defend Action; whoever rolls higher succeeds. A tie always goes for the
attacker (or the initiating actor).
