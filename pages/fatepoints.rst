Fate Points
===========

Each Player Character starts the Session with 3 Fate Points. The GM gets
a number of Fate Points equal to the number of Player Characters x 3
(this means that you need 6 Fate Point tokens per player).

When players spend Fate Points, they go to the GM’s pool (unless they
are compelling another PC!).

The GM only spends Fate Points in two situations:

1. when compelling a Player Character. The Fate Point goes to the
   compelled Character.
2. when GM controlled NPCs invoke Aspects. The Fate Point goes to the
   most hindered PC by that action. When that’s not immediately clear,
   choose who gets the Fate Point:

   1. The Character with less Fate Points.
   2. Let the players decide.
   3. The GM decides.

This means that the GM pool of Fate Points is limited by design. If the
GM runs out of Fate Points, they cannot compel Player Characters nor
invoke NPC Aspects. This also means that the Players (or even a single
player) could theoretically hoard all of the Fate Points from the table
and refrain from using them. This is a valid tactic, self-balanced by
the fact that in microFATE all PCs and NPCs have a free first invoke on
each Action, and because players can compel each other, effectively
passing Fate Points between themselves. This way, in microFATE the Fate
Point Pool functions as a stronger equalizer in terms of tension and
comeback potential than in Fate Core.

Using Fate Points
-----------------

Very similar to Fate Core, players can use Fate Points to:

-  Declare a minor detail or fact (approved or vetoed by the GM)
-  Invoke an Aspect and gain a +2 to their Action roll
-  Invoke an Aspect and reroll all of their dice on their Action roll
-  Compel another Player Character’s Aspects, giving the Fate Point to
   that player
-  Deny the activation of a Compel, paying a Fate Point to the player
   (or GM) that initiated the compel
