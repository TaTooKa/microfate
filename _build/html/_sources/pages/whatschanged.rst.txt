===============

No skills or Approaches
-----------------------

In microFATE your Character only has Aspects and Consequences.

When you do an Action, you roll at +0 by default.

If you invoke an Aspect as part of your Action, you gain +2 as usual,
but **the first invocation for the action is free** (it doesn’t require
a Fate Point and it doesn’t expend a free invoke).

Any other Aspect that you want to invoke as part of your action requires
the usual cost (a Fate Point or the expenditure of a free invoke if the
Aspect had those).

No Stress, only Consequences
----------------------------

In microFATE there are no Stress boxes.

Player Characters can have 3 Consequences (1 mild, 1 moderate, 1 severe)
before being taken out.

Opposing characters or environmental hazards/challenges can have
different amounts (“slots”) of Consequences, depending on their
“narrative resistance”.

To accommodate for this, the outcome of the Attack Action has changed:
you don't deal Stress with your shifts. If you succeed on an Attack action, you either impose a Mild or Moderate Consequence.
