Consequences
============

This section goes into detail about Consequences in microFATE. They are mostly the same as in Fate Core (see `Consequences <https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/types-aspects#consequences>`_ in the SRD), with some exceptions.


How Consequences work
---------------------

When a character does an Attack Action, instead of dealing Stress as in Fate Core, they
deal direct Consequences to the opponent [#]_ . See :hoverxref:`Action Outcomes <attack-action>` for Consequence
severity depending on the result of your roll.

When a Character :hoverxref:`Defends <defend-action>` and fails, their player has to decide if they
get taken out or suffer a Consequence. If they already have their slot
filled with another previous Consequence, they have to fill the next
higher available slot. If they cannot take more Consequences of the
required severity, they are automatically taken out.

Keep in mind that Consequences always come with a free invoke for the
side of whoever applied that Consequence on your Character.

.. [#] Remember you can always :hoverxref:`Concede <conceding>` before the dice roll. When a player declares they are going to attack, you can choose to Concede and avoid taking consequences. After the roll is made, though, there's no going back: If you fail your **Defense**, you either take a **Consequence** or get **Taken Out**. See `Conceding the Conflict <https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/conceding-conflict>`_ in the Fate SRD.

Removing Consequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consequences have to be treated before being removed (unless the fiction
makes them obsolete in some way, but that’s unlikely).

If you don’t do anything about them, they could just stay as a negative
Aspect on your Character. Oftentimes, an untreated Consequence
(specially a physical ailment) might get worse. The GM might tell you to
rename it to a worse state or even move it to a more severe slot if you
don’t do anything about it.

To start the recovery process of a Consequence, you (or an ally, or an
NPC) will have to do an Overcome Action. The Default difficulty is 2 for
Mild, 4 for Moderate and 6 for Severe Consequences. Failure might mean
that you didn’t treat the Consequence, or you do but at a serious cost.

If the treatment is successful, you must rename the Consequence to an
appropriate “healing state”. It will then be completely healed (and
thus, removed from your Character) in a period of time depending on
their severity:

-  Mild consequences take one full scene after treatment to clear.
-  Moderate consequences last longer, taking a full session after
   treatment to clear.
-  Severe consequences only clear when you reach an Advancement.
