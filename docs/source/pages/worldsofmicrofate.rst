They are usually comprised of lists of sample Aspects for GMs and players to use or get inspiration from.

The idea of a "Worlds of microFATE" document is that anyone can pick it up to start playing with *close-to-zero* prep.

Worlds' structure
-----------------

Anyone can design a **"Worlds of microFATE"** document. These guidelines should help when creating your own.

A World of microFATE can have:

* A setting/scenario description or primer.[#]_

* A list of ":hoverxref:`Hardcoded Aspect Types <hardcoded-aspect-types>`" for Characters in the setting.

* A list of sample Aspects for Characters, and optionally for opposition, scenes, scenarios, etc.

* Adventure hooks or scenario-specific ideas, and/or "set-piece" scene suggestions that make sense for the setting or genre.

.. [#] This can be anything from a one-liner like *"Star Wars in the Clone Wars era"*, to a custom universe and situation explainer that spans hundreds of pages.
