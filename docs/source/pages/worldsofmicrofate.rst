Worlds of microFATE
===================

**"Worlds of microFATE"** are setting-specific addon snippets that can be used with microFATE. 
They are usually comprised of lists of sample Aspects for GMs and players to use or get inspiration from.

The idea of a "Worlds of microFATE" document is that anyone can pick it up to start playing with *close-to-zero* prep.

Worlds' structure
-----------------

Anyone can design a **"Worlds of microFATE"** document. These guidelines should help when creating your own.

A World of microFATE can have:

* A setting/scenario description or primer. [#]_

* A list of ":hoverxref:`Hardcoded Aspect Types <hardcoded-aspect-types>`" for Characters in the setting.

* A list of sample Aspects for Characters, and optionally for opposition, scenes, scenarios, etc. [#]_

* Adventure hooks or scenario-specific ideas, and/or "set-piece" scene suggestions that make sense for the setting or genre. [#]_

.. [#] This can be anything from a one-liner like *"Star Wars in the Clone Wars era"*, to a custom universe and situation explainer that spans hundreds of pages.

.. [#] Veteran Fate players might not even need these examples, but for newcomers to the hobby or "trad RPGers" that come from other classic RPGs, these lists of Aspects are extremely helpful to kickstart and speed up character creation.

.. [#] These are mostly geared towards the GM, to allow a *pick and play* improv-style format in which to start running a microFATE game without prep.



following are some examples of **Worlds of microFATE** to use at the table or to base your own World.
