Strategic Crunch
----------------

You can add more crunch and interesting mechanics to any version of Fate, including microFATE, with minimal or no changes.
Most are listed and thoroughly explained in the `Advanced Conflict <https://fate-srd.com/war-ashes/advanced-conflict>`_ section of the Fate SRD.

-  Team weight - see `Weight <https://fate-srd.com/war-ashes/advanced-conflict#weight>`_ in the Fate SRD.
-  Contested movement - see `Movement on the Battlefield <https://fate-srd.com/war-ashes/advanced-conflict#movement-on-the-battlefield>`_ in the Fate SRD.
-  Maneuvers - Push/Pull/Charge - see `Maneuvers <https://fate-srd.com/war-ashes/advanced-conflict#maneuvers>`_ in the Fate SRD.
-  Zones and Barriers - see `Zones <https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/zones>`_ in the Fate SRD.
-  Weapon/Armor Ratings - see `Weapons & Armor <https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/more-examples-extras#weapon-and-armor-ratings>`_ in the Fate SRD.

Stunts
------

(Optional rule)

It is possible to expand microFATE with Stunts to give more depth to
Character builds. By the nature of this hack, Stunts can’t refer to
Skills or Weapon/Armor ratings etc, since those are not present in
microFATE. They must refer to generic situations and/or modify one of
the four basic actions. Or they could tinker with other core mechanics
like zone movement, barriers, action resolution, healing consequences,
etc.

Some cases might seem too similar to just invoking an Aspect. The main
difference is that the Stunt effects are always active without having to
pay for an invocation, hence it is important to make them more
constrained (in specificity of a contextual situation) so that they
don’t imbalance the main mechanic of Aspects.

Hardcoded Aspect Types
----------------------

(optional rule)

A good way to make Character Creation more interesting and give players
something more to build upon (while limiting them to a specific genre)
is to give Hardcoded Aspect Types to the starting Aspect list. Similar
to how you have a High Concept and Trouble slots, the other Aspects can
also have their types established beforehand.

For instance, a Superhero game could have the Aspect Types be defined
as:

-  Epithet
-  Personal Issue
-  Identity
-  Nemesis
-  Weakness
-  Connection
-  Catchphrase
-  Motivation

A high fantasy adventure game could have this list:

-  Archetype
-  Trouble
-  Relationship
-  Ancestry
-  Unique Item
-  Faction

Since Characters have a maximum of 5 Aspects to start with, players can
choose which types to create from that list up to that max, but they
cannot deviate from it. They must create one Aspect of each category.

Aspects and Free Invokes
------------------------

Aspects work just like in Fate Core. The new addition is that you can
place Free Invokes on an Aspect your own Character has, which is useful
if you want to stack multiple invokes but you don’t have enough Fate
Points. It will take more time (multiple successful CaA actions to place
the free invokes) but it will not require Fate Points. In the fiction
this represents a character preparing or getting ready to do something
big.

How to track Free Invokes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is imperative that you keep track of the Free Invokes on Aspects by
their team, since both Player Characters and the opposing team can have
them (and they can’t use the invokes that belong to the other side!). A
good way to do this is by using different colors (blue or green for
players, red for enemies).

If you are playing on a table, another option is to place small colored
tokens on each Aspect. A blue token represents a single free invoke for
the players; a red one is only usable by the opposing team. When used,
simply remove the token from the Aspect, representing that you spent the
free invocation.
