Advancement
===========

In microFATE, Characters advance by gaining new Aspects (and/or
modifying existing ones). Advancement happens when the GM deems fit
(normally after the Characters made some notable progress or finished an
Adventure or Scenario).

When Player Characters advance, they can add a new Aspect and/or modify
an older one they have. There is no limit to the amount of Aspects a
Character can have. Both the addition of a new Aspect or the
modification of an old one must be justified narratively.

During Advancement Characters can also remove a Severe Consequence that
they had, provided it is already in a “healing state”.

Gaining new Aspects as “debt”
-----------------------------

Sometimes the fiction requires that a Character gains a new Aspect (be
it because they acquired an important item, a new trait or connection,
or whatever that would be narratively important). In this case, the GM
can allow the addition of the Aspect, but the player must mark that they
have a “debt” to be paid during the next Advance. When that happens,
that Character does not gain a new Aspect, but effectively pays for the
one they acquired before. It is recommended that only one Aspect (at
most two) is granted “as debt” in this way.
