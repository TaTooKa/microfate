Actions
=======

As it was briefly explained in the "Changes from Fate Core" section, one of the most notable differences in microFATE is that you always roll at +0, but **you have a free invoke on every Action** (that means that you will usually be rolling at +2 minimum).

You still cannot invoke the same Aspect more than once in the same Action.

.. _action-outcomes:

Action Outcomes
---------------

üëé Fail
~~~~~~

If you roll lower than your opposition, you fail.

üëç Succeed
~~~~~~~~~

If you roll equal to or higher than your opposition by 1 or 2, you succeed.

üí™ Exceed

If you roll higher than your opposition by 3 or more, you succeed with style (a Critical hit!).

Difficulty
----------

Difficulty for an Action roll can be either **fixed** or **opposed**.

When you attempt something against the environment or an entity that
cannot perform an action by themselves, it is normally a **fixed
difficulty**, arbitrarily set by the GM. It ranges from 0 to 8, being 2 to 4 the default for most
cases.

     - Poor
   * - -2
     - Terrible

When your Action is made against an opponent or entity that can actively
defend, it is normally an **opposed roll**, with the defender setting the
difficulty with a Defend Action; whoever rolls higher succeeds. A tie always goes for the
attacker (or the initiating actor).
