Changes from Fate Core
======================

If you are already familiarized with Fate Core, this overview will get you up to speed with microFATE.

No Skills or Approaches
-----------------------

In microFATE your Character only has **Aspects** and **Consequences**.

When you do an Action, you roll at +0 by default.

If you invoke an Aspect as part of your Action, you gain +2 as usual,
but **the first invocation for the action is free** (it doesn’t require
a Fate Point and it doesn’t expend a free invoke). [#]_

Any other Aspect that you want to invoke as part of your action requires
the usual cost (a Fate Point or the expenditure of a free invoke if the
Aspect had those). [#]_

.. [#] You might choose not to invoke any Aspect and roll at +0, but why would you? In most situations you can probably find an excuse to use one of your Aspects or one from the Scene. If you can't, maybe you should try to do something else instead!
.. [#] Fate Points are a finite resource. But invoking Aspects is the only way to get high rolls in microFATE, since the players can't resort to a high Skill bonus on their character sheet. This encourages players to be aware of every Aspect in the scene, and create new ones or put more free invokes on existing ones, improving the narrative and steering away from more "automated" traditions.

No Stress, only Consequences
----------------------------

In microFATE **there are no Stress boxes**, nor the concept of Stress. [#]_

Player Characters can have 3 Consequences (1 Mild, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe)
before being taken out. [#]_

Opposing characters or environmental hazards/challenges can have
different amounts (or “slots”) of Consequences, depending on their
“narrative resistance”.

To accommodate for this, the outcome of the :hoverxref:`Attack Action <attack-action>` has changed:
you don't deal Stress with your shifts. If you succeed on an Attack action, you either impose a Mild or Moderate Consequence. [#]_

.. [#] The answer to the question of "have I been hit?" is already covered in the Defense Action. Soaking Stress with Stress boxes felt like a second chance at avoiding harm once you had failed your Defense roll, which didn't make much sense to us. We prefer going directly to dealing with the Consequences (pun intended). 
.. [#] This makes microFATE's characters much less "durable" than their Core/Condensed counterparts. This is designed this way to encourage players to play more defensively (**creating Advantages** between each other) or to :hoverxref:`Concede <conceding>` before risking taking Consequences or being Taken Out. Conflicts tend to be much faster and every successful Attack action has more weight, causing real Consequences (pun also intended).
.. [#] This changes the way that most Fate Core Conflicts play out: instead of stacking lots of Advantages or invocations on a single huge hit, in microFATE you are encouraged to split your effort: since you can't take out a named NPC with a single hit (the max you can inflict per Action is a Moderate Consequence), you need to distribute your advantages (or Fate Points and free invokes) among several Actions.

Fixed Fate Point pool
---------------------
microFATE uses a :hoverxref:`fixed and limited pool of Fate Points <limited-fate-point-pool>`. Player Characters get 3 at the start of the session and there's no concept of **Refresh** or maximum amount of Fate Points per player.
GMs get 3 Fate Points per player.
Fate points go from player to player (or GM), and the total amount of Fate Points in the table always remains the same. [#]_

.. [#] Since when one side of the pool empties, the other cannot gain any new Fate Points, this creates a resource to administer strategically by both sides, while maintaining simplicity. But this can create situations in which a player doesn't receive a Fate Point because the opposite Pool is empty (like when :hoverxref:`Conceding a Conflict <conceding>`.) or in which some actions are discouraged (like a self-compel when there is no Fate Point to be gained.). This is by design, to encourage the expenditure of Fate Points (or discourage "Fate Point hoarding") for them to be moved from side to side in a constant manner.


No special rules for ties in Action Outcomes
--------------------------------------------

When you roll the dice and you match the difficulty, it counts as a Success. [#]_

.. [#] We found the results for ties superfluous and more confusing for new players than anything.

"Succeed with style" is called "Exceed"
---------------------------------------

It is shorter and sounds way cooler. [#]_

.. [#] ...And it also rhymes with "Succeed", so it was a no-brainer.
