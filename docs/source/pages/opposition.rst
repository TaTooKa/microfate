Opposition
==========

Opposition Types
----------------

Minions
~~~~~~~

**A Minion doesn’t have Consequence slots**. They are nameless henchmen or lesser adversaries. Once successfully attacked, they are taken out.

They can have any number of Aspects, normally ranging from 1 to 4.

Menaces
~~~~~~~

**A Menace has 1 mild and 1 moderate Consequence slots**. Usually, any named NPC in a Conflict is at least a Menace. A group of henchmen could also be considered as a single Menace. [#]_

They can have any number of Aspects, normally ranging from 3 to 5.

Nemesis
~~~~~~~

**A Nemesis has 1 mild, 1 moderate and 1 severe Consequence slots**,
effectively putting them at the same level as Player Characters. [#]_

They can have any number of Aspects, normally ranging from 4 to 7.

.. [#] When you design a group of henchmen or horde as a Menace (to speed up combat, or for simplicity's sake), Consequences don't necessarily have to represent specific injuries; they can represent dwindling numbers or a low morale. 
.. [#] A Nemesis is usually an important adversary that can give the player characters a hard time. If the GM wants to make them even more hard to be taken out, they can give them even more Consequence slots, but they should also consider giving them :hoverxref:`“invulnerability” Aspects <immunity-aspects>` instead: since *Aspects Are True*, when they declare that the actor cannot be affected or harmed by something, it doesn’t matter how hard the player Characters attack with that source, it won’t make a dent.

Hazards and Traps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazards and Traps are usually not sentient obstacles, but could also be
“taken out” of the Conflict with attacks (If the GM wants to treat them
as regular obstacles but with more narrative weight, consider making
them a :hoverxref:`Challenge <challenges>`).

When you want your Hazard or Trap to be something that the Player
Characters can actively disable with some sort of Attack (it doesn’t
have to be physical or brute force actions), **you can give them
Condition slots. 1 mild and 1 moderate is a good default.** These
Consequences should represent the mechanisms of the device failing, the
obstacle’s power dwindling, or something along those lines. When it runs
out of Consequences and is effectively taken out, you can consider it
deactivated or disabled.

Some hazards could be passive opposition that only cause negative
effects if the player Characters fail on their :hoverxref:`Overcome <overcome-action>` rolls. Others
could be active actors that do Attack actions on the Characters (Hidden
darts, rolling boulders, a far away sniper, etc). In those cases, they
get a turn just like other adversary NPC, and they can do :hoverxref:`Attack <attack-action>` Actions
(and sometimes :hoverxref:`Create an Advantage <caa-action>` Actions too!).
