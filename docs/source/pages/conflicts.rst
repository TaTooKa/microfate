Conflicts
=========

A Conflict is a type of Scene in which the PCs are pitted against one or
more opponents or teams of antagonists, their objectives are opposed or
collide somehow, and there is a possibility of forcefully “taking
enemies out of the action”.

Objectives by side
------------------

Before the Conflict starts, both players and the GM must agree on the
objective of the Conflict for all sides. Writing it down is recommended.
Usually the Player Characters want to achieve something and there is
opposition from GM NPCs that want something that conflicts with the
Characters’ objective.

This is important and needs to be clear during the Conflict, because
Concessions are based on the clarity of the objectives from both sides.

Turn Order
----------

When you need to determine Turn Order (mostly during Conflicts), have
everyone roll normally (+0), and add bonuses with Aspects as usual
(first invoked one is free). Highest goes first, ties act simultaneously
(or the players involved decide who goes first).

It is recommended to do this only once at the start of a Conflict, but
if the context changes and the GM feels it warrants a new check of Turn
Order, you can do it again, and as many times as you want.

On the other hand, some GMs prefer to use “popcorn initiative”: The
Character most likely to act first given the context of the fiction
takes a turn, and when it ends, they choose the next Character in the
queue (allies or enemies!). Repeat that process until all of the
involved actors in the Conflict had their turn.

.. _conceding:

Conceding a Conflict
--------------------

Concessions work very similarly to Fate Core: if you concede a Conflict, you
don’t gain what you were looking for, but you don’t get taken out. [#]_
Player-controlled Characters gain 1 Fate Point plus another one per each
Consequence they gained during this Conflict. These Fate Points come from the GM pool. [#]_
**GM-controlled Characters don't get any Fate Point for conceding**.

When the players concede, the GM will propose a negative outcome that is
not as bad as if they were all taken out, but that still implies they
lost their objective. They can negotiate the details (or propose another
outcome of similar significance) but ultimately the GM has the last
word.

The same applies when NPCs concede, but the players have the last word
as to what is an acceptable compromise.

Keep in mind that conceding is meant to give the acting character(s) an
out; As long as the proposition doesn’t feel extremely fantastic or too
much of a stretch, the opposing side should accept it in benefit of a
smooth narrative.

.. [#] This means that if the GM doesn't have enough Fate Points in their pool, the conceding PC gets fewer (or none)!

Zones
-----

TODO

Moving to one adjacent Zone is free; moving more is an Overcome Action

Pushing someone to another adjacent zone is an opposed Overcome action

Each Zone must have at least one Aspect

Barriers
--------

TODO

A Barrier is an Aspect between two or more zones that needs to be
Overcome to traverse
